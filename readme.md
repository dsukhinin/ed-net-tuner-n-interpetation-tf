# Envelope Detector net: hyperparams tuner and wights interpretation

This repository is Tensorflow reimplementation of small and interpretable deep neural network Envelope Detector-net(ED-net) that is used in brain decoding experiments, initially developed in \cite{petrosyan2021} for motor BCI and studied in depth in \cite{petrosyan2022}.
Here implemented using Keras tuner and contains functions for weights interpretation. 


## Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage 
Edit config.json. 
And follow hyper_ed_net_tuner.ipynb for use case.

Data files format:

- x_file -  (b,t,c)  b - n train samples, t - time step, —Å -n channels
- y_file - (b,a) where b - n train samples, a - class (int from 0 to n_classes-1)

Tuner main params: 
- n_trials - should be big enough to cover search space (for example, in case we want to tune 4 params with 4 possible values each, then  n_trials=4*4=16) 
- n_runs_per_trial - should be around 3-5
<br/>
Next select params to tune and set the boundaries by modifying:   _param_min | max | step
